# My Personal Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website. This is where I get to show off my skills and projects in a way that's uniquely me. I'm excited to share it with you!

## A Little Bit About the Project

I built this portfolio to be a reflection of my passion for software engineering, machine learning, and hardware. It's a single-page application built with Next.js, and I've poured a lot of love into making it not just functional, but also a joy to explore.

### The Tech Stack

I chose a modern and robust tech stack to bring this project to life:

-   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, which is great for performance and SEO.
-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: The go-to library for building user interfaces.
-   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For type safety and a better developer experience.
-   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
-   **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: To add some smooth and delightful animations.

### The Structure

I've kept the project structure clean and organized, making it easy to navigate and understand.

-   `src/app/`: This is the heart of the application, where all the components and pages reside.
    -   `components/`: Each section of the page (Hero, About, Skills, etc.) is broken down into its own component.
    -   `layout.tsx`: The main layout of the application, where I've also implemented the SEO metadata.
    -   `page.tsx`: The main page component that brings all the sections together.
-   `public/`: All the static assets like images, fonts, and icons are stored here.
-   `next.config.ts`: The configuration file for Next.js.

## A Note on Design

I've put a lot of thought into the design of this portfolio to make it stand out. The goal was to create something that is both visually appealing and a true representation of my personality. I believe in the power of a clean, straightforward, and unique design that doesn't get in the way of the content.

While I'm thrilled to share my code and my process with you, I would kindly ask that you **do not copy the design** of this website. I believe that every developer should have a portfolio that is a true reflection of their own skills and personality. So, feel free to get inspired, but please create something that is uniquely yours!

## Let's Connect!

I'm always open to connecting with other developers, so feel free to reach out to me. You can find my contact information on the portfolio itself.

Thanks for stopping by!
